# banana-puzzle-clp
A monkey lives in a tree with a branch off which hangs 10 vines. The vines hang in a row at exact distances of 1 metre apart. Somewhat perturbed by this unnatural degree of regularly, the monkey wonders how to hang his four bananas so that each banana is hung in a different vine. Furthermore, the money wants to hang his bananas so that for any three bananas, x, y and z, of his four bananas, the
distance between x and y is different from the distance between y and z, which are both different from the distance between x and z. For example, the monkey can place the bananas in vines 1, 2, 4 and 8; 1, 2, 4, and 9; 3, 1, 10 and 7, etc. The monkey observes that are many solutions to this problem and therefore wonders how many ways he has available for arranging his bananas.
